## üîê Cryptographic Fundamentals

### 1. Key Derivation (PBKDF2)

**What it is**: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) converts a password into a cryptographic key.

**Why it matters**: 
- Passwords are often weak and predictable
- We need a strong, random key for encryption
- PBKDF2 makes brute force attacks computationally expensive

**How it works**:
```javascript
// Step 1: Take a password and salt
const password = "mypassword123";
const salt = generateRandomBytes(32); // Random salt

// Step 2: Apply PBKDF2 with many iterations
const key = await crypto.subtle.deriveKey({
    name: 'PBKDF2',
    salt: salt,
    iterations: 100000,  // Makes it slow!
    hash: 'SHA-256'
}, passwordKey, { name: 'AES-GCM', length: 256 }, false, ['encrypt', 'decrypt']);
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **Brute Force Protection**: 100,000 iterations make attacks slow
- **Salt Protection**: Prevents rainbow table attacks
- **Tunable Security**: Can increase iterations as computers get faster

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker tries to guess your password by trying millions of combinations. With PBKDF2, each guess takes much longer, making the attack impractical.

### 2. Symmetric Encryption (AES-256-GCM)

**What it is**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) provides both encryption and authentication.

**Why it matters**:
- Data must be encrypted to remain confidential
- We need to detect if data has been tampered with
- AES-256 is the current standard for secure encryption

**How it works**:
```javascript
// Encryption
const iv = generateRandomBytes(12); // Unique for each encryption
const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt({
    name: 'AES-GCM',
    iv: iv
}, key, data);

// Decryption
const decrypted = await crypto.subtle.decrypt({
    name: 'AES-GCM',
    iv: iv
}, key, encrypted);
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **Confidentiality**: Data is unreadable without the key
- **Integrity**: Any tampering is detected during decryption
- **Authentication**: Ensures data came from authorized source

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker gains access to your encrypted data. Without the key, they cannot read it. If they try to modify it, decryption will fail.

### 3. Cryptographically Secure Randomness

**What it is**: Using `crypto.getRandomValues()` instead of `Math.random()` for security-critical operations.

**Why it matters**:
- `Math.random()` is predictable and can be guessed
- Security operations need true randomness
- Predictable values can be exploited

**How it works**:
```javascript
// ‚ùå BAD: Predictable randomness
const badPassword = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Cryptographically secure randomness
const randomArray = new Uint8Array(16);
crypto.getRandomValues(randomArray);
const goodPassword = generatePasswordFromRandomBytes(randomArray);
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **Unpredictable**: Cannot be guessed or calculated
- **High Entropy**: True randomness from hardware sources
- **Attack Resistance**: Prevents pattern-based attacks

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker analyzes patterns in generated passwords. With `Math.random()`, they might predict future passwords. With `crypto.getRandomValues()`, this is impossible.

## üîë Password Security

### 1. Password Strength Validation

**What it is**: A comprehensive system to evaluate password strength and provide feedback.

**Why it matters**:
- Weak passwords are the most common security vulnerability
- Users need guidance on creating strong passwords
- Automated validation prevents weak password usage

**How it works**:
```javascript
function validatePasswordStrength(password) {
    let score = 0;
    
    // Length checks
    if (password.length >= 8) score += 1;
    if (password.length >= 12) score += 1;
    if (password.length >= 16) score += 1;
    
    // Character variety
    if (/[a-z]/.test(password)) score += 1;  // lowercase
    if (/[A-Z]/.test(password)) score += 1;  // uppercase
    if (/[0-9]/.test(password)) score += 1;  // numbers
    if (/[^A-Za-z0-9]/.test(password)) score += 1;  // special chars
    
    // Penalties for weak patterns
    if (/123|abc|password/i.test(password)) score -= 2;
    
    return { score, strength: getStrengthLevel(score) };
}
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **Prevents Weak Passwords**: Blocks common weak patterns
- **User Education**: Teaches what makes passwords strong
- **Consistent Standards**: Enforces minimum security requirements

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker uses a dictionary of common passwords. Strong password validation prevents users from choosing easily guessable passwords.

### 2. Secure Password Generation

**What it is**: Creating cryptographically random passwords with user-defined criteria.

**Why it matters**:
- Humans are bad at creating random passwords
- Generated passwords are more secure than user-created ones
- Customizable generation meets different security requirements

**How it works**:
```javascript
function generateSecurePassword(options) {
    const { length, includeUppercase, includeLowercase, includeNumbers, includeSpecial } = options;
    
    // Build character set based on options
    let chars = '';
    if (includeUppercase) chars += 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    if (includeLowercase) chars += 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
    if (includeNumbers) chars += '0123456789';
    if (includeSpecial) chars += '!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?';
    
    // Generate random password
    const randomArray = new Uint8Array(length);
    crypto.getRandomValues(randomArray);
    
    let password = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        const randomIndex = randomArray[i] % chars.length;
        password += chars[randomIndex];
    }
    
    return password;
}
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **True Randomness**: Uses cryptographically secure random generation
- **No Patterns**: Eliminates human bias and patterns
- **Configurable**: Adapts to different security requirements

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker tries to guess passwords based on common human patterns (birthdays, names, etc.). Generated passwords have no such patterns.

## üåê Web Security

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection

**What it is**: Preventing malicious scripts from being executed in the browser.

**Why it matters**:
- XSS is one of the most common web vulnerabilities
- Attackers can steal passwords, session tokens, and other sensitive data
- Input sanitization is essential for any web application

**How it works**:
```javascript
// ‚ùå BAD: Direct HTML insertion
element.innerHTML = userInput; // Vulnerable to XSS

// ‚úÖ GOOD: HTML escaping
function escapeHtml(text) {
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = text; // Safely escapes HTML
    return div.innerHTML;
}

element.innerHTML = escapeHtml(userInput); // Safe
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **Script Injection Prevention**: Blocks malicious JavaScript
- **Data Integrity**: Preserves user input without execution
- **Universal Protection**: Works against all XSS vectors

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a password field. Without escaping, this would execute JavaScript and potentially steal data.

### 2. Secure Storage Practices

**What it is**: Ensuring sensitive data is properly encrypted before storage.

**Why it matters**:
- Browser storage is accessible to other scripts
- Local storage is not encrypted by default
- Sensitive data must be encrypted before storage

**How it works**:
```javascript
// ‚ùå BAD: Plain text storage
localStorage.setItem('passwords', JSON.stringify(passwords));

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Encrypted storage
const encryptedPasswords = [];
for (const password of passwords) {
    const encrypted = await encryptData(JSON.stringify(password), key);
    encryptedPasswords.push(encrypted);
}
localStorage.setItem('encryptedPasswords', JSON.stringify(encryptedPasswords));
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted data is unreadable without the key
- **Access Control**: Only users with the master password can access data
- **Tamper Detection**: Modified data cannot be decrypted

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker gains access to your browser's local storage. Without encryption, they can read all your passwords. With encryption, the data is useless without the key.

## üõ°Ô∏è Attack Prevention

### 1. Brute Force Attack Prevention

**What it is**: Making password guessing computationally expensive.

**Why it matters**:
- Brute force attacks try every possible password
- Modern computers can try millions of passwords per second
- We need to slow down these attacks

**How it works**:
```javascript
// PBKDF2 with high iteration count
const CRYPTO_CONFIG = {
    PBKDF2_ITERATIONS: 100000  // Makes each guess expensive
};

// Each password attempt now takes significant time
const key = await deriveKeyFromPassword(password, salt, 100000);
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **Computational Cost**: Each guess takes significant time
- **Scalable Security**: Can increase iterations as computers get faster
- **Practical Protection**: Makes attacks economically unfeasible

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker tries to guess your master password. With 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations, each guess takes ~100ms instead of microseconds, making the attack impractical.

### 2. Rainbow Table Attack Prevention

**What it is**: Using random salt to prevent pre-computed password attacks.

**Why it matters**:
- Rainbow tables contain pre-computed hashes for common passwords
- Without salt, attackers can quickly look up password hashes
- Salt makes each password unique even if the password is the same

**How it works**:
```javascript
// Generate unique salt for each user
const salt = await generateRandomBytes(32);

// Salt is combined with password before hashing
const key = await deriveKeyFromPassword(password, salt, iterations);
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **Unique Hashing**: Same password produces different hashes with different salts
- **Table Resistance**: Pre-computed tables become useless
- **Individual Protection**: Each user's data is independently protected

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker has a database of common password hashes. Without salt, they can quickly look up your password. With salt, they must compute hashes specifically for your salt.

### 3. Supply Chain Attack Prevention

**What it is**: Avoiding external dependencies that could be compromised.

**Why it matters**:
- External libraries can be compromised
- CDN attacks can inject malicious code
- Self-contained applications are more secure

**How it works**:
```html
<!-- ‚ùå BAD: External dependencies -->
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/crypto-library.js"></script>

<!-- ‚úÖ GOOD: Self-contained -->
<script src="script.js"></script> <!-- All code is local -->
```

**Security Benefits**:
- **No External Risk**: Cannot be compromised by external attacks
- **Version Control**: You control exactly what code runs
- **Auditability**: All code can be reviewed and verified

**Real-World Attack**: An attacker compromises a CDN and injects malicious code into a popular library. Applications using that CDN are now vulnerable. Self-contained applications are immune to this attack.
